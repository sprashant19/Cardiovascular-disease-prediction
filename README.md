# Cardiovascular-disease-prediction


**Problem Statement**


Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 
approximately 31% of all deaths globally. Early diagnosis and prevention of CVDs are crucial in 
reducing the mortality and morbidity associated with these diseases. The objective of this 
project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the risk of CVDs in individuals 
based on their health data.

**Dataset**


The dataset used for this project is the “Cardiovascular Disease dataset” from Kaggle. The 
dataset contains 70,000 records of patients aged 30-70 years, and it includes 11 features such 
as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status, and more. The target 
variable is a binary variable indicating whether the patient has CVD or not.


**Objectives**


The objectives of this project are:
1. To explore and visualize the dataset.
2. To preprocess and clean the dataset.
3. To build a machine learning model to predict the risk of CVDs.
4. To evaluate the performance of the model


**Approach**

The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. 


**Technical Aspect**

1)Cleaning the data 

2)Visualizing the data using various modules such as Matplotlib, plotly and Seaborn.

3)Built Logistic regression model, that fitted good with AUROC score of 78%.

Finally,done the feature importance of the said model.

**Result**

Age,Chlosterol,Systolic blood pressure ('ap_hi') and smoking habits as the most important feature to predict whether a person will suffer from CVD or not.

**Technologies Used**

1. Google Colab Notebook

2. Pandas 

3. Matplotlib

4. Seaborn

5. Plotly

6. Sckit-Learn
